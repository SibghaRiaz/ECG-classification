# ECG Classification 

The code contains the implementation of a method for the automatic classification of electrocardiograms (ECG) based on the combination of multiple Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The method relies on the time intervals between consequent beats
and their morphology for the ECG characterisation.  Different descriptors based on wavelets, local binary patterns
(LBP), higher order statistics (HOS) and several amplitude values were employed.
